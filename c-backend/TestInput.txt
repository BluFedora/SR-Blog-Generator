  This is the first version of my website. This was before I had a strong
  understanding of web technologies so this was made in Adobe Muse
  (now discontinued). I was 15-17 years old at the time so many things about the
  site just sucked and I didn't have many projects under my belt so it wasn't
  all that useful.
